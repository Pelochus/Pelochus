## About me
I am a last year Computer Science student, specialized in Computer Engineering. My main interests are low-level and embedded systems programming, Linux server administration, electronics and cybersecurity.

My favourite programming languages are ```C```, ```C++``` and ```Bash```, but I'm also knowledgeable about ```Rust```, ```Python``` and, to some extent, ```Java``` and ```SQL```

## About my projects
Some of my most featured projects:
- **[ezrknpu](https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknpu):** Automated configuration and installation of libraries needed to use the NPU found in the Rockchip's SoCs. Focusing currently on the RK3588, which is found on SBCs like the Orange Pi 5 or Radxa Rock 5B which are capable of accelerating ChatGPT-like LLMs or running diverse AI applications like image recognition with minimal power consumption.
- **[Rockobot](https://github.com/Pelochus/rockobot):** Battlebot made for a college subject. 3D design and printed, designed a PCB for it and programmed it with an Arduino NANO. Featured on the [Arduino blog](https://blog.arduino.cc/2023/09/29/can-you-smell-what-the-rockobot-is-cooking/)
- **[pelochus-homelab](https://github.com/Pelochus/pelochus-homelab):** Applying DevOps techniques to my personal home server with Linux for easy and automated deployment with Ansible and Docker
- **[LUSA](https://github.com/Pelochus/LUSA):** Embedded system for my father's car. Designed a PCB and programmed an Arduino NANO for controlling an ultrasonic sensor and buzzer to alert the car's driver of collisions

Here you can find my Bachelor's thesis:
- **[bt-crazyflies](https://github.com/Pelochus/bt-crazyflies):** Control and Coordination of Crazyflie Drones based on the Paparazzi UAV project.

You can also see below my different contributions to various open source projects like:
- **Armbian:** Debian based distro for ARM devices. Updated a NPU driver in their Linux kernel fork.
- **Ultimaker Cura:** 3D printing slicer. Updated some incorrect Spanish translations
